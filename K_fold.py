# K-fold splitting ensemble
# Deep learning model has its randomness and uncertainty. To achieve a more robust and reliable model, 
# we adopted K-fold spliting to create an ensemble model.
# We split the training dataset into k folds. We use 1 fold as the validation dataset during training, 
# and the remaining k-1 folds as the training dataset. This way we will have k models with each model 
# learning different variations of the dataset.
# Then the predictions of all the k models are averaged to get the final prediction.
